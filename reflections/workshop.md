# Attend a workshop/event outside of class
### HIST 5152 Reflections Assignment

## About this assignment
Hands-on experience really is the best way to learn how to work with digital tools. We will work on small skills-oriented projects in our Lab during class, but this is a chance for you to engage with a topic or tool that is interesting or important to you personally in a structured, supportive environment.

### Due date
Due by November 28, 2022.

## Directions
1. Check out the Events calendar I've set up for this class to find a topic that you might be interested in. If you find one that isn't listed on the calendar, run it by me;  but it should be fine with me if you go to one of those, instead.
2. Once you've identified your event, make sure to register if necessary and check to see if you might need to prepare anything beforehand (sometimes, you might need to install some software or download a dataset or something along those lines to follow along in the workshop.) 
3. Then, make sure to attend it! Take notes along the way to help aid in your reflection process later.
4. Create a brief recap of the workshop/event answering the questions below.
5. Submit your materials.

## Guidelines for the recap
The recap can take the form of a written essay, a video, a screen recorded demo, an infographic, blog post, or just about any other medium you prefer. In your recap, briefly explain (in no more than 1250 words/ 10 minutes):

1. The name, date, topic, organizer, and other basic details of the workshop.
2. The structure of the workshop: how was it organized (thematically, step-by-step, etc.)? Give details about any processes, lectures, or preparatory work that made up the workshop.
3. How was your experience? Did you learn something new? Were there things that frustrated you, and if so, how did you overcome them (or how might they be overcome next time)?
4. Did you come away with an example/prototype/work-in-progress? Include a link or screenshot if possible.
5. What advice would you give to someone else who might be interested in learning more about this same topic?

On October 17th, I attended A Conversation with Lisa Nakamura Hosted by The University of Pennsylvania. The conversation took place over YouTube Live and was co-sponsored by Creative Ventures, the Price Lab for Digital Humanities, and PennImmersive. Lisa Nakamura was in conversation with Whitney Trettien and Amanda Licastro. Whitney and Amanda posed most of the questions for Lisa and directed the direction of the conversation. They also facilitated Q&A with event attendees. Lisa Nakamura was speaking about her recently published book, Racist Zoombombing, as well as her book, Technopercarious, and Digitizing Race: Visual Cultures of the Internet. Racist Zoombombing discusses the racist harassment and hate speech that takes place on Zoom. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the usage of Zoom skyrocketed. With that came an increase of trolls and other hackers sporadically attending and interrupting Zoom calls uninvited, coining the new term Zoom bombers. Often these Zoom bombers start spamming Zoom calls with racist epithets and other slurs.  

Although Lisa Nakamura‚Äôs book focused on zoom bombers, she spent the majority of her conversation discussing the erasure of labor in academic work, specifically the work performed in labs by senior and newer academics, researchers, and technicians. Nakamura discussed how she attempted to combat the erasure of labor by authoring her book as the lab alongside the individual authors. She spoke about how her decision to author a book as a lab was a fight that she did not think she would win. Nakamura explained how the benefit to authoring it as a lab is to place the work of the lab at the forefront, directly confronting the often distance between authored work and the labs that produced them. She said that authoring the book is especially important for entry level and junior faculty as it includes the labor they contributed to the lab and includes these faculty as authors as well, instead of being grouped together as ‚Äúassistants.‚Äù Nakamura stated that ‚Äúmaking things and recognizing that the people who are part of making things are human and not part of machines‚Äù is an essential part in challenging and changing how we view, think of, and speak about academia and other research labor. Nakamura did recognize how the disagreement between authors shows throughout the book, allowing differences to stand instead of milling them all together and therefore erasing the (collaborative) thought process.  

The conversation between Lisa Nakamura and the hosts then changed to the topic of virtual reality. Nakamura stated that ‚ÄúVR can‚Äôt put you in another‚Äôs body, but it can produce spurious feelings of empathy as knowledge. This kind of embodiment is false, and it's toxic.‚Äù In her chapter, ‚ÄúFeeling Good about Feeling Bad: Virtuous Virtual Reality and the Automation of Racial Empathy,‚Äù further elaborates her ideas about this.  

In thinking about identity tourism and platform capitalism I share the same weary sentiments about VR as an empathy building tool. It makes me question the idea of place taking since feeling sad is not a political agenda for diversity. We see how these failed examples with VR Holocaust and other immersion labs where you practice being Black. The augmented reality (AR) AR feeling of race and gender is harmful and distracting. It does not and cannot account for an embodied experience. 

In our class the question of whether empathy is even a useful tool was discussed. When discussing this, it is worth considering whether empathy is just a stand-in for our feelings (or mysticism), making it a shortcut where we can erase people. In the case of VR, Nakamura agrees that it enables ‚Äòplayers‚Äô to say, ‚Äúwe get it‚Äù and then move on. After attending this event, I better understood how empathy is founded on projection. This means that empathy isn‚Äôt a fundamentally useful technique and trauma empathy should not be used without a full analysis and understanding of the criticisms and shortcomings. When using VR for empathy, it is important to understand how it can inevitably replace experiences and dilute them.
